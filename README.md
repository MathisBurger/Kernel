## Project Information

This is the kernel of the whole modular smart home application. You can run it in standalone mode and it will only 
serve the scaffold of the application. 

## Usage

Find it out yourself. There will be more documententation with the development of this project.

## Future development

This project will be developed not that quickly, because it is a big side project of me. I will work most of my time on my other projects.
